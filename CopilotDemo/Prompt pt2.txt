Given the following openapi.json file referenced, generate an equivalent WeatherForecast.feature file and backing class as shown in the prior example but for the `#{path-goes-here}` path. Finally remind me that I need to set the new feature file to copy on build

// usage instructions: Reference openapi.json, replace `#{path-goes-here}` with your path, i.e. `/getpokemon`
// Note: The `/getpokemon` route does not have a header, so I wouldn't expect one
